## Track Information
**BPM:** 120
**Length:** 3:12 / 96 bars

## How to use
**There are 3 possible ways I've designed this track to be used:**

1. The full track (with or without drums), played one time or on loop.
_Ex: a fairly linear level that will reliably play the same way for the same length._

2. Mix the stems yourself in your game's engine dynamically.
_Ex: Approaching enemies or events may trigger certain tracks to be audible._

3. Loop the main loop sequence until you want to exit (intro -> main loop -> outro)
_Ex: you kill all the enemies and trigger the outro._
